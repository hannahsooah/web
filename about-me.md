hello! i'm a 20-something year old in the bay area just tryin' my best and
encountering more of my belovedness in God every day :)

during the weekdays, i'm a software engineer at meta doing lil codemonkey things;\
outside of that, i can be found journaling at a cafe or doing life-giving
activities with precious people
