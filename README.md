# personal site

Jekyll website published through github pages

thought maybe i should have one too? nothing too special, i don't typically like front-end

## to develop locally:

clone this repo

install necessary dependencies with `make init` then run `make` in a terminal

* the local version of the site should be up and running at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

run `make clean` to remove generated files

## things to add later:

* change work image (need to take a nicer pic of my table)
* beef up this website idk lol
