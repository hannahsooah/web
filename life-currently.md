    <p>i definitely spend the most of my time at work as a software engineer at meta.
    i'm trying to work hard and do well as it reflect on my character as i try to
    reflect the character of Christ, although it gets <em>slightly</em> tricky when
    that happens to be in C++ drowning in abundant tech debt heh :') </p>
    <p>unsurprisingly, i've also been thinking a lot about workplace interpersonal
    relationships / boundaries, how it intersects with the Christian calling to love
    our neighbors as ourselves, how to communicate well in an incredibly culturally
    diverse company, what it means to have purpose in the work i think about 40+
    hours a week, potential future career paths, and work-life balance / routine</p>
    <p>please please let me know if you're also thinking about these topics, cuz i'd
    love to have a conversation buddy!</p>

        <p>outside of these things, i love visiting new cafes by myself (though please,
        feel free to join me) and simply journaling while enjoying a cup of iced latte.
        i'm also in love with chasing sunsets and sunrises, and always down for an
        adventure if it involves coffee or good views :)</p>
        <p>hobbies include but are not limited to: knitting, music, reading,
        and talking about exercise (but not quite exercising)</p>
