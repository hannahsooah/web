      <h3>yarn!</h3>

    the proverbs 31 woman seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands (v.13)<br>
    I prefer wool to flax (linen), but both are nice! and other yarns too hehe<br><br>
    a sweater takes ~1300-1500 meters of yarn (which is a lot unfortunately) but i promise to use it
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://knittingforolive.com/">knitting for olive</a> is really popular (i've never gotten anything from there)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.garnstudio.com/yarns.php?cid=17">DROPS yarn</a> is a more budget friendly option ahaha</li>
    </ul>
    I'm sure there are more options, I just haven't looked around that much ^^
