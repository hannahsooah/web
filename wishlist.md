      <h3>yarn!</h3>
    </header>
    the proverbs 31 woman seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands (v.13)<br>
    I prefer wool to flax (linen), but both are nice! and other yarns too hehe<br><br>
    a sweater takes ~1300-1500 meters of yarn (which is a lot unfortunately) but i promise to use it
    <ul>
    <li>I want to try yarn from <a href="https://knittingforolive.com/">knitting for olive</a>! It's really popular but... kinda expensive and I've never used it </li>
    <li>I also find myself a regular at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/nGEVTyMr4ThExT7M6">Uncommon Threads</a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1R3R54fgKYEphGV8">Fillory Yarn</a> for local yarn store options ^^</li>
    </ul>
